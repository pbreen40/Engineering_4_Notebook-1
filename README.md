## Getting the Pi Online
I had to use a hotspot, set yours to 2.5 ghz under AP Band if on android, this took me a while to figure out the hard way.
## Dice Roller
This assignment was basic one I got the logic to work. I used a simple random function and an if stament to kill the program. I would recommend using an online compiler to write the code as it takes lots of time to do it on the pi. One I wrote it all I just copied it over. I've been doing lots of Java is CSA so the switch to Python was nice, its all much easier in my opinion, or at least simpler. 
## Calculator
### Description
In this assignment we used functions to do an array of operations on two use inputed numbers. I'd never used functions in Python before so this was a fun challange. 
### Code
I'm going to talk about the two sections that gave me the most trouble. The first is taking the input from a function. ```python print("Sum:\t\t" , doMath(a,b,1)) ```

### Lessons(s) Learned

- You can give a functions values to work with (called an "argument"). You use `return` to spit back out the answer or whatever, not a `print`.
- Taking inputs is as easy as `x = input("Message")
- Rounding is very easy, just use `round(x,y)`, x being the number and y being the places to round to.
