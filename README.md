## Getting the Pi Online
### I had to use a hotspot, set yours to 2.5 ghz under AP Band if on android, this took me a while to figure out the hard way.
## Dice Roller
### This assignment was basic one I got the logic to work. I used a simple random function and an if stament to kill the program. I would recommend using an online compiler to write the code as it takes lots of time to do it on the pi. One I wrote it all I just copied it over. I've been doing lots of Java is CSA so the switch to Python was nice, its all much easier in my opinion, or at least simpler. 
## Calculator
### Description
#### In this assignment we used functions to do an array of operations on two use inputed numbers. I'd never used functions in Python before so this was a fun challange.
